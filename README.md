# EBRAINS Workflow Components

This repository contains a library of [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org) components
for use in building neuroscience data analysis workflows.

What makes them "EBRAINS" components?
- While some of the components can be used in any environment, others are closely tied to the [EBRAINS research infrastructure](https://www.ebrains.eu/), in particular to how data and metadata are stored, and/or require the user to have an EBRAINS account.
- The components run in computational environments built from the EBRAINS software distribution.
- The components are (will be soon!) available in the EBRAINS workflow execution environment.
- Development of this library is funded by the EU Horizon Europe EBRAINS-2.0 grant ([Grant agreement 101147319](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101147319)).
