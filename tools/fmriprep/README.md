#fMRIPrep CWL wrapper

According to documentation (https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/installation.html), there are 2 ways to install fMRIPrep:

  - using a container and the container wrapper
  - install fMRIPrep manually

The Docker images for this tool will install fMRIPrep using manual install instructions in order to not use nested containers running.
The fMRIPrep docker wrapper will also be tested.
